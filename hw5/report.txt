1. Roughly 10-12
2. This homework was moderate, but only because
  I had some knowledge of graph algorithms prior
3. I did this 100% alone.
4. I would say I understand this 85-90%
5. I wish I had more time to work on this,
  so that I could submit the extra credit as well!

Thanks for a fun and challenging class,
Adam Najman
