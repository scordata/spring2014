  Dijkstra's Algorithm for the single-source shortest path
  problem for a graph with non-negative edges.

  Problem #:
    Single-source shortest path problem that may have negative edges.
  Analysis #:
    1) Consider shortest path P from s to t in #:
        0)   s->t1->t2->...->tk-1->tk is P where tk = t
        I)   P is acyclic
        II)  |E| <= |V| - 1 (same property as graph with non-neg edges)
        III) s->t1->...->ti in P is the shortest path from s to ti in the graph
            that has at most i edges (1 <= i <= k)
        I, II, III constraint:
          Graph has no negative cycle. 
    2) If G has a negative cycle, out shortest path from s to t would be -inf
        with +inf edges if s can reach a NC and this NC can reach t.
