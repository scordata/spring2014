1. Approx 15 hours coding/debugging
          ~5 hours research
          (It was fun, though)

2. I would rate this assignment somewhere between
  moderate and difficult, if only due to my limited
  knowledge on the topics. A good refresher for Dijkstra's.

3. I worked on this by myself, save for wikipedia/CLRS.

4. I'm still missing something on quickselect,
  but binary search, moving pointers, quicksort,
  running times etc are all coming back to me by now.

5. Most of the python I/O is a mystery to me. Can we 
  cover some of it in class? The docs assume a body
  of knowledge that I have yet to gain...
