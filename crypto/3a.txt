Question 3a

Find all n that satisfy phi(n) = 110

To begin our examination, let's review what we know about
Euler's totient function:

  1. Assuming n is prime, phi(n) = n-1
  2. If n > 2, phi(n) is even.
  3. 0 > phi(n) > n
  4. phi(n*m) = phi(n) * phi(m)

This means that we should begin our search starting with
the first n to yeild phi(n) = 110, and go up from there.

If n = 121, then phi(n) = 110. Our first mark. We should
exclude all primes higher than this number, as by 
definition 1, phi(n) would not equal 110, but rather n-1.
Since 111 is not prime, that leaves us with the composite 
numbers greater than 121. 

Experimentation shows us that the next number is 242. Can
we find more? How many more are there? Is there a closed 
form solution to this?

We also know that if we raise a prime p to some power, a,
so we have p^a, we can say that: 

  phi(p^a) = p^a - p^(a-1)

This is because p^a has p^(a-1) many common factors with it.
So, by subtracting one from the other, we are left with all
the non-common factors.
