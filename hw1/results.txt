1. I spent approx 15-20 hours between working
    on the problems, learning python, and
    researching algorithms

2. These problems ranged from simple to 
    moderately difficult. One major pitfall
    was having to learn much of python before
    attempting these. For example, learning about
    generators and iterators made printing sorted
    lists easier - however finding that technique
    took some time to stumble upon.

3. I did not work with other classmates, however
   I did some research about python from the docs
   and some python blogs.

4. I'd say I've grasped about 75% of the material
   so far.

5. It's a shame that we've had to move so fast
   to cover both the basics of python and these
   algorithmic techniques. It would have been nice
   to have a brief review of the data structures
   and algorithms we plan on using. For some of us,
   it has been a year or more since our data 
   structures class.
