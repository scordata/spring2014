1) I spent about 15-20 hours on this assignment

2) This was a difficult assignment

3) I worked alone, but I did ask for help from
  Lemao during his office hours re: Viterbi

4) I would say I understand most of it, although
  DP is still hard for me to do. Maybe 60-75%
  The hard part is comming up with a recurrance.

5) I'd like to see more concepts in the course 
  as opposed to the same ones getting progressivly
  more difficult.
