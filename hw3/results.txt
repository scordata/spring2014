HomeWork #3

0) Adam Najman
1) ~30 hours
2) I would rate this as very difficult.
  Not the problems, per se, but the concept of DP.
  It took me ~30 hours of research and coding,
  but I'm finally able to grasp the concept. 
  It was worth it. This is a powerful technique.
3) I did all the coding by myself, with the help of
 various blog posts, CLRS, some other algorithm books,
 DP lectures on youtube etc. 
4) I would say that right now maybe 60% understood.
  If I do a few more problems this should start to 
  approach 100%. 
5) This assignment was surprisingly non-trivial,
  hence its late delivery. The problems are deceptive 
  - they are easy to describe, but not easy at all to 
  program a solution.
  Attempting to solve these in Java/C++ or a language
  that I've been more familiar in might have cut down
  on development time, as the debugging process is 
  ingrained. I'm learning to love Pdb.
